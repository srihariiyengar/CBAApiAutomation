Built using Java and integrated with Cucumber for behavior-driven development, this framework provides a robust testing platform that ensures the accuracy and reliability of weather-related data services.

## Key Features
- **API Integration:** Fetches weather and air pollution data for specified cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Cucumber BDD Framework:** Utilizes Behavior Driven Development for clear and understandable test scenario descriptions.
- **Java and Maven Setup:** Employs Java for core functionalities and Maven for dependency management and project builds.
